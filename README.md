# Homework № 1
## LEARNING OF DATA TYPES AND OPERATIONS WITH THEM

## Task № 1:
Write a Java program that:
- describes a three-digit integer *number* number (*for example*, 123);
- finds and displays to the console the difference between *number* number and number composed of the digits of the *number*, but taken in reverse order (for the specified example, the reverse number is 321).

## Task № 2:
Write a Java program that converts the weight given in pounds to kilograms, but outputs the number of received kilograms and grams separately (in 1 lb 453.6 grams).

## Task № 3:
Write a Java program that calculates and displays to the console the amount of profit for a given deposit (*for example*, 10000) for a given number of months (*for example*, 6) at a specified percentage per annum (*for example*, 12%).

## Requirements:
1) Use variables to store program data.
2) Use arithmetic operations for calculations and, if necessary, data types casting.
3) Use the *System.out.println(...)* operator to output the result of calculations.
4) Read books:
	- Head First Java, O'Reilly.
	- Java Code Convention.
	- Clean Code, Robert C. Martin.
5) Watch the video <https://itvdn.com/ru/specialities/java-developer>.

# Homework № 2

</p>

## Requirements:
1) During the coding should be used Java coding conventions.
2) Keep reading books:
	- Head First Java, O'Reilly.
	- Java Code Convention.
	- Clean Code, Robert C. Martin.
3) Keep watching the video <https://itvdn.com/ru/specialities/java-developer>.

# Homework № 3
## LEARNING OF METHODS AND PROCESSING LINE

## Task № 1:
Write a Java program that inputs some string and prints to the console all the unique characters of this string. String processing is done in a separate method.

## Task № 2:
Write a Java program that inputs an integer, converts it to binary representation, storing it as a string, and prints the result to the console. The conversion is done in a separate method.

## Requirements:
1) During the coding should be used Java coding conventions.
2) Methods of data processing should not carry out the output of the result, it should be returned from methods.

## Additional tasks for those who wish:
## Task № 1:
Write a Java program that:
- inputs an integer variable and outputs the result of its processing;
- processing is a method that gets an integer, determines the last two digits and returns them as a string of characters in reverse order. *For example*, the number is 2546, the result is "64".

## Task № 2:
Write a Java program that:
- inputs the height of the pyramid and passes it to the method for outputing the pyramid;
- the method outputs to the console the pyramid of the obtained height (value in the range from 1 to 9). For example, for *height* = 3:

<div align="center">1</div>
<div align="center">121</div>
<div align="center">12321</div>
<div align="center">1234321</div>

## Task № 3:
Write a Java program that:
- describes a method that finds and returns the first character of the word under the given number in the given string. Restriction: words in a line are separated only by spaces.
- inputs some text and a word number, and then uses a method to process and outputs the result.
