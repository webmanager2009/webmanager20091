# Homework № 1
## LEARNING OF DATA TYPES AND OPERATIONS WITH THEM

## Task № 1:
Write a Java program that:
- describes a three-digit integer *number* number (*for example*, 123);
- finds and displays to the console the difference between *number* number and number composed of the digits of the *number*, but taken in reverse order (for the specified example, the reverse number is 321).

## Task № 2:
Write a Java program that converts the weight given in pounds to kilograms, but outputs the number of received kilograms and grams separately (in 1 lb 453.6 grams).

## Task № 3:
Write a Java program that calculates and displays to the console the amount of profit for a given deposit (*for example*, 10000) for a given number of months (*for example*, 6) at a specified percentage per annum (*for example*, 12%).

## Requirements:
1) Use variables to store program data.
2) Use arithmetic operations for calculations and, if necessary, data types casting.
3) Use the *System.out.println(...)* operator to output the result of calculations.
4) Read books:
	- Head First Java, O'Reilly.
	- Java Code Convention.
	- Clean Code, Robert C. Martin.
5) Watch the video <https://itvdn.com/ru/specialities/java-developer>.
